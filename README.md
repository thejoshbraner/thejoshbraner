Hey there! I'm Josh!

I'm an aspiring Front-End / React / React Native developer in the San Antonio, TX area!

I am currently working on Foodie, an app all about keeping track of all those new places to eat you kept stored in a note and forgot about.

I'm constantly learning! As of 2/13/2023 I will graduate from NuCamp's Front-End coding bootcamp with honors.
